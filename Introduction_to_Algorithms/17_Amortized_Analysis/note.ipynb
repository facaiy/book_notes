    "In an __amortized analysis__, we averget the time required to perform a sequence of data-structure operations over all the operations performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amortized analsis differs from average-case analysis in that probability is not involved; an amortized analysis guarantees the _average performance of each operation in the worst case__.\n",

    "Bear in mind that the charges assigned during an amortized analysis are for analysis purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform an amortized analysis, we often gain insight into a particular data structure, and this insight can help us optimize the design."
